# QHOSYN
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

QHOSYN (Pronounced like "cosine") is the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Synthesizer.

The software employs an accurate quantum simulation of an observable in a superposition of eigenstates up to the n=15 energy level. It can be used to generate evolving stochastic sound and control signals directly using a quantum wave function based on the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation. Through sonic exploration, the user can generate "quantum sounds" and gain an aesthetic understanding of quantum space.

QHOSYN was designed as part of my PhD research in order to facilitate the composition of my piece _Psi_. It is still in a rough state that was useful for me in my research, but may be confusing and buggy for anyone else to use. Version 1, which will be more user-friendly, will be released soon.

# Building

## Dependencies

terminal to run bash

git

cmake version 3.0 or higher

## How to setup
On a bash shell:

    git clone https://github.com/rodneydup/QHOSYN
    cd QHOSYN
    ./configure.sh
    ./run.sh

This will compile the project, and run the binary if compilation is successful.
